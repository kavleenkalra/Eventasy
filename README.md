# Eventasy

Eventasy is an Android app which I created as part of my Udacity's Android Developer Nanodegree. 
You can download it from the following Play Store link: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gmail.eventasy

This app has been made in accordance with the Material Design guidelines provided by Google. 
I have made use of the following libraries:
- Picasso for handling the loading and caching of images.
- Retrofit for handling the HTTP requests.
- Admob for showing ads.

The key features of the app are:
- Get the details and description of events.
- Filter the list of events on the basis of location.
- Categorize the events.
- Sort the list of events according to date, popularity and radius. 
- Search for events according to keywords.
- Mark the events as favorite and view them later.
- Share the details of an event.
- Locate the event venue on Map.
- Add a widget to your home screen which contains a list your favorite events.
